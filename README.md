This is basically a Transaction System for a Parking Garage.

•	I have used web services,REST API so that localhost JSON Data(Containing in time, out time, license plate number) can be accessed through the HTML template using javascript.

•	REST API imports all data from JSON file then HTML,CSS shows it into a table format in DOM.

•	Javascript logic is used to convert timestamps to date , month, time format and to calculate total hours a car was in the garage and a total amount in $$ a customer should pay.

•	The amount is 0$ for customers who parked their cars for <1 hour.
